You need two files for MicroMon to function correctly:
1. In your code directory, i.e. "~/butterflyeffect/code", we require a file "config.txt"
    - The first line is the path to your diskAccess.txt that is dynamically updated
    - This second line is a static float variable, alpha, which is the weight distribution
        - Weight for Network Latency: alpha
        - Weight for Micro Metric influence: 1 - alpha
    - The third line is either 0 or 1, 0 if you intend on using the server to service requests, and 1 if you want to exclude the server from being considered
    - The fourth line is the IP address of the server

Example of config.txt:
/users/NolanR/diskAccess.txt
0.25
1
192.168.1.1

This configuration sets the following:
    1. The path to the dynamic disk access variable as "/users/NolanR/diskaccess.txt
    2. The alpha to 0.25, meaning the network latency weight is 0.25, disk access latency is 0.75
    3. 1 denotes that we wish to exclude the server from request consideration
    4. This sets the IP address of the server to "192.168.1.1"
