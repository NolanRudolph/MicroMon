You need two files for MicroMon to function correctly:
1. In your code directory, i.e. "~/butterflyeffect/code", we require a file "config.txt"
    - The first line is the path to your diskAccess.txt that is dynamically updated
    - This second line is a static float variable, alpha, which is the weight distribution
        - Weight for Network Latency: alpha
        - Weight for Micro Metric influence: 1 - alpha
    - e.g. "cassandra.config" containing "/users/NolanR/diskAccess.txt\n0.5" would provide the path of the disk access as "/home/NolanR/diskAccess.txt" and give a 50-50 weight distribution
